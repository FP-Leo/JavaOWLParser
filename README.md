# JavaOWLParser
 An OWL parser written in Java
# Explanation
 This is an OWL Parser using OWL API, SWRL API, and Pellet API. The code needs to be compiled with Java 11, and `Download Declared Dependencies` needs to be done for it to work properly.
To ensure the code runs correctly, `Absolute Paths` in the code need to be modified according to the computer.
We have kept everything in one folder, but for better understanding of the changes, we also saved them in separate folders.
The rules we added were initially added using Protege SWRLTab to ensure they work, but later we removed them from the project and re-added them using SWRL API.
